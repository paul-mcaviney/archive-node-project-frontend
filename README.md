# archive-node-project-frontend
 This is the frontend project for Infura's Ethereum Archive Node article.
 Once complete, the user will be able to enter an Ethereum wallet address to receive some stats from 2021. These stats are only available through the use of an archive node.

 To get started, first navigate through the command line to the folder you would like to work from and then clone this repo:

 `git clone https://github.com/paul-mcaviney/archive-node-project-frontend.git`

 Next, change directories into the new folder and install the dependencies:

 `cd archive-node-project-frontend`

 `npm i`

 You should now be set to follow along with the rest of the article!
